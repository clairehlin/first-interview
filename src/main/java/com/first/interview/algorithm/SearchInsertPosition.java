Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

binary search algorithm

compare value in the middle.
if the same, found.
if the target value is smaller than left, continue to search left
if the target value is bigger than middle, continue to search right
